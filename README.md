# Bedrock Evaluation Workshop

This repository contains hands-on workshops for evaluating and working with Amazon Bedrock, Amazon's fully managed service that offers foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies.

## Workshop Structure

The repository is organized into four main sections, each focusing on different aspects of working with Amazon Bedrock:

### Create Custom Dataset
Located in `create-custom-dataset/`

Learn how to prepare and structure data for use with Bedrock models. This section covers:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Dataset formatting requirements
- Data validation and cleaning
- Best practices for dataset creation
- Handling different data types (text, images, etc.)

### Bring Your Own Inference
Located in `bring-your-own-inference/`

This workshop demonstrates how to deploy and use your own custom inference endpoints with Amazon Bedrock. Learn how to:
- Set up custom inference endpoints
- Integrate your models with Bedrock's infrastructure
- Optimize inference performance
- Handle different model formats and requirements


### Fine-tune Custom Model
Located in `fine-tune-custom-model/`

Explore the process of fine-tuning foundation models to your specific use case. Topics include:
- Selecting appropriate base models
- Preparing training data
- Configuring fine-tuning parameters
- Monitoring training progress
- Evaluating model performance
- Deploying fine-tuned models

### Import Custom Model
Located in `import-custom-model/`

Learn how to import external models into the Bedrock ecosystem. This workshop covers:
- Model import requirements and specifications
- Converting models to compatible formats
- Setting up model artifacts
- Configuring model endpoints
- Testing imported models
